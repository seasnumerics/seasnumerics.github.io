Lattice Boltzmann File Listing
==================================

lattice.hh - Header for the lattice class which stores relevant particle distribution function
			 information and macroscopic quantities at a grid point, and implements the collide
			 and stream functions.

lattice.cc - Defines the functions relevant to the lattice class.

lbm.hh - Header for lbm class which sets up a simulation grid of pointers to lattice objects,
		 and solves the Boltzmann transport equation forward in time.

lbm.cc - Defines the functions relevant to the lbm class.

models.cc - Defines different flow initializations.

lbm_params.hh - Sets fluid parameters such as Reynolds number and relaxation constant.

lbm_test.cc - Top-level script to simulate a fluid system with the lattice Boltzmann method.

lbm_plot.py - Python script to plot speed, density, and vorticity from output files.
